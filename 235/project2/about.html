                <p>The Pokedex has been meticulously developed as a distinguished project for academic purposes created
                    in
                    3 weeks. It seamlessly integrates with the PokiAPI, leveraging its extensive repository of Pokémon
                    data
                    to offer users a refined and comprehensive experience. The objective is to create a site that
                    provides
                    basic yet insightful knowledge at a glance, catering to all Pokemon enthusiasts.</p>

                <p>Users are able to create and register their own accounts to save various Pokemons. There is no limit

                <p>NOTE: Due to project requirement, the accounts are saved in local storage rather than utilizing a
                    database like mySQL. Using local storage is <b>NOT</b> secure and recommened.</p>

                    and an image of the Pokemon. Hovering over the Pokemon will outline the box they are in to give the
                    user a clear indication. Lastly, the user can press on the Pokemon and it will generate an
                    infographic and show that to the user.</p>

                <h3>WHY DID I MAKE IT?</h3>
                <p>"I want to be the very best. Like no one ever was." - Ash<br>I made this as a school project, but why
                    did I choose Pokémon? Many people, including myself, grew up watching Pokémon. With various
                    intricacies related to each Pokémon, this makes Pokémon appeal to people with diverse experiences.
                    So, I wanted to create a website that lets anyone, regardless of experience, explore the various
                    Pokémon as well as learn more about the ones you're interested in.</p>

                <h3>HOW DID I MAKE IT?</h3>
                <h4>Here are the steps I used to create the <b>best</b> Pokédex website!</h4>
                <p><u>Step 1:</u> Gathering intel and creating mockups of the site you envisioned.</p>
                <p><u>Step 2:</u> Soak in the API, relax and take your final breaths as you start consuming the API.</p>
                <p><u>Step 3:</u> Javascript time! Just jump straight into it, start by making all the neccessary API
                    calls and get all the data!</p>
                <p><u>Step 4:</u> You got the data, you got the vision, now start building! One div at a time, start
                    layering each info onto one another.</p>
                <p><u>Step 5:</u> Putting it all together, cook up the final divs and wa-la, you got yourself a fully
                    functional site, without css.</p>
                <p><u>Step 6:</u> Cascading Style Sheets... alas the time has come, when all but css is done. Design
                    principles, color theory, "why is this div not centering???", and rwd - responsive web design.</p>
                <h4>And that is how <b>I</b> created the <i>best</i> Pokédex website ever.</h4>

                <h3 class="center">THOUGHTS</h3>
                <p>My thought process was pretty easy at first, them abition took over and I ended up challenging myself
                    to various things. Initially I wanted to create the infographic, display screen was never meant to
                    be.</p>
                <p>While working on the JavaScript, I realize I would be scrolling a lot due to various features I
                    wanted to add, so I ended up breaking the files up by functionality. There is a file for each task,
                    that way debugging is much simplier and I don't have to scroll through hundreds of line to find the
                    function.</p>
                <p>That thought of seperating each feature into it's own file ended up following to the css as well.
                    Most of it is in 1 file but I split them up for various tasks and that made finding and editing the
                    respective elements easier.</p>
                <p>On the right, I have images of several iterations of my mockups. As you can see, I frequently took
                    screenshots of my page and drew over them as I envisioned what I wanted the website to look like.
                    None of the mockups had any color since I am really bad at picking out color, hence the very bland
                    and simplistic color choices.</p>
