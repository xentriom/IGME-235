                    inner ninja and slice through each and every veggie that comes your way. Beware, some veggies may

                <h2>OVERCOMING THE HURDLE</h2>
                <p>Getting the project started and getting the flow was the hard part. Once i got started, got things layed out,
                    everything else was plug and chug. There was a few issued I had that made me pause and think but
                    nothing that difficult. After getting about 70% of the way done, I did realize a significant flaw
                    and I redid the whole variable system to make use of JavaScript ovbjects and splitting them up into
                    game data, adjustable data, and session data. This change made everything else such as upgrades and
                    setting chages very easy.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="docuChanged">
                <h2>WHAT CHANGED?</h2>
                <p>Many things changed since my first vision of this project. One of the change was a more and better
                    shop which consisted of more upgrades. As I worked, I realize how difficult it was so I made the
                    colors a majority of the upgrade. Another major feature I ended up never adding was the effect of
                    the veggie being split in half after falling, that was too much....</p>

                    and make this good. The shop was a messaive success and it took the longest time, first deciding on
                    what to put, then implementing them. I am also very pleased with the settings, though I didn't have
                    as much customizations as I initially wanted.</p>
