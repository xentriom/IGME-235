                    "Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its stellar storytelling and satisfying 
                    progression systems offer dozens of hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying 
                    for gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. Combat boasts layers of strategy for 
                    those willing to dig into details without barring more casual players from enjoying it. Its worldbuilding 
                    also expands outside of the main story into the side missions and interactable objects, making an already 
                    captivating world even more lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself playing even 
                    months from now."<br><br>
