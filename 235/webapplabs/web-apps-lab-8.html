         car array, sorted by .year, ascending (oldest to most recent)
         Use Array.sort() on the cars array - and read about writing a comparison function here:

         3 - Create a new array named 'newerYearsOnly' that contains only the .year property 
         (not the entire car object) of those cars that are .year 2010 or newer. 
         Use Array.map() on the cars array:
         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
         
         This will give you a few undefined values. Use Array.filter() to get rid of these 
         undefined values so that newerYearsOnly contains only years (Numbers)
         
         Hint: you could use Number.isInteger() or the typeof operator:
         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger
         https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
         
         You could do this additional filter on a separate filter on the different lines,
         or as a "one-liner" by chaining the method calls.
